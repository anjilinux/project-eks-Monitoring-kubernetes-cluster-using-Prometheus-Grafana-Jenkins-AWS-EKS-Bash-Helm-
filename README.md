  ## How Prometheus Works

### Prometheus uses a pull based system that sends HTTP requests. Each request is called a scrape, and is created according to the config instructions defined in your deployment file. Each response to a scrape is parsed and stored in a repository along with the relevant metrics.

### This repository is, essentially, a custom database deployed on a server, that can handle huge amounts of data. One Prometheus server can simultaneously monitor thousands of machines.
 ### Built into Kubernetes – Prometheus works seamlessly with Kubernetes. Both Kubernetes and Prometheus are Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects and work seamlessly together (Prometheus is also bundled with Kubernetes).Query language and APIs – Prometheus provides APIs that enable convenient access to monitoring metrics.Many exporters and libraries – Prometheus offers a wide range of libraries and exporters for collecting application metrics.
